# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, you can use any PNG images with these dimensions as placeholders.
The extension will work without icons, but Chrome may show a default icon.
