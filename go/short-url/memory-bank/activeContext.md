# Active Context: Go Short URL Server (Initial Implementation)

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is completing the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) implementation of the Go short URL server as defined in `projectbrief.md`. This involves creating the basic server structure, implementing the core shortening and redirection logic, and setting up in-memory storage.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Initialized Go module (`go mod init short-url`) in `go/short-url`.
- Created `main.go` with basic HTTP server setup using `net/http`, including placeholder handlers for `/shorten` and `/`.
- Created `store.go` defining the `URLStore` interface and implementing `InMemoryURLStore` with a mutex-protected map and a simple counter-based ID generator.
- Updated `main.go` to:
  - Initialize `InMemoryURLStore`.
  - Create an `App` struct to hold dependencies (the store).
  - Implement `handleShorten` (POST `/shorten`) to read the long URL, generate an ID, store the mapping, and return the short URL.
  - Implement `handleRedirect` (GET `/{shortID}`) to look up the long URL and perform an HTTP redirect.
- Created initial Memory Bank documentation (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).

## 3. Next Steps

- Create `progress.md` to finalize the initial Memory Bank documentation.
- Present the completed MVP implementation to the user.
- Address potential future enhancements outlined in `systemPatterns.md` if requested (e.g., persistent storage, better ID generation).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Storage:** Using in-memory storage for simplicity, acknowledging its limitations (data loss on restart).
- **ID Generation:** Using a simple counter, acknowledging its limitations (predictability, limited character set).
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling implemented for request method validation, body reading, URL parsing, and store operations. More robust error handling could be added.
- **Dependencies:** Sticking to the Go standard library for the MVP.
