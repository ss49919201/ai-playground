# Progress: Go Short URL Server (Initial MVP)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Startup:** The HTTP server starts and listens on port 8080 (`go run main.go`).
- **URL Shortening (POST /shorten):**
  - Accepts a POST request with a URL in the body.
  - Performs basic validation (checks if the input looks like a URL).
  - Generates a sequential numeric ID (starting from 1).
  - Stores the mapping between the ID and the original URL in memory.
  - Returns the shortened URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/1`) with HTTP status 201 Created.
- **Redirection (GET /{shortID}):**
  - Accepts a GET request with a short ID in the path (e.g., `/1`).
  - Looks up the original URL associated with the ID in the in-memory store.
  - Redirects the client to the original URL using HTTP status 302 Found.
  - Returns HTTP status 404 Not Found if the ID doesn't exist.
- **Basic Routing:** Handles `/shorten` and `/{shortID}` paths correctly. Root path (`/`) returns 404.
- **Concurrency:** The in-memory store uses `sync.RWMutex` to handle concurrent requests safely.
- **Web UI (GET /):**
  - Serves `static/index.html` when accessing the root path.
  - The HTML page contains a form to input a long URL.
  - JavaScript on the page sends the long URL to the `/shorten` API via a POST request using `fetch`.
  - Displays the returned short URL or an error message on the page.
- **Static File Serving:** Serves files from the `static` directory under the `/static/` path (though currently only `index.html` exists and is served at root).

## 2. What's Left to Build (MVP Scope)

- None. The core requirements for the initial MVP as defined in `projectbrief.md` are implemented.

## 3. Current Status

- **Complete (MVP + Web UI):** The core API and the basic Web UI are functional according to the updated scope.
- **Ready for Testing:** The server can be run (`go run main.go`) and accessed via a web browser at `http://localhost:8080`. API can still be tested with `curl`.

## 4. Known Issues / Limitations (MVP + Web UI)

- **Data Persistence:** Data is stored only in memory and will be lost when the server stops.
- **ID Generation:** IDs are simple sequential integers, making them predictable and potentially easy to guess. They are also not very "short" if the count grows large.
- **Scalability:** The in-memory store is not suitable for large numbers of URLs or high traffic loads.
- **Error Handling:** Basic, could be more robust (e.g., more specific error messages, logging).
- **Configuration:** Port number (`8080`) is hardcoded.
- **Security:** No protection against abuse (e.g., rate limiting, malicious URL checks).
- **Base URL:** The base URL for the short link (`http://localhost:8080`) is hardcoded in both the backend (`main.go`) and frontend (`index.html` implicitly via relative path in `fetch`), which might not always be correct depending on deployment (e.g., behind a proxy).
- **UI Styling:** Very basic CSS styling.
- **Frontend Error Handling:** Basic error display in the UI.
